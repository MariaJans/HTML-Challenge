        <h3>THREATS TO ANIMAL OWNERSHIP</h3>
        <h3>What You Need To Know - <i>Threats to Animal Ownership</i></h3>
        <p>Animal extremist organizations like the Humane Society of <b>the United States (HSUS)</b>,<br> People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals <sub>(PETA)</sub>, the American Society of Prevention<br> of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) seek to put an end to animal ownership.<br>In their eyes, animals should share rights with humans. They equate animal ownership to slavery.<br>Their goals of abolishing animal ownership and animal breeding is an ideology not known by many.<br>

            An important part of our mission at Protect The Harvest is to protect the right to own and interact with animals.<br> Pets and livestock enrich the lives of Americans all across the country.<br><q>Animals also offer assistance to people in several different capacities.</q>
